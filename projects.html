            <h2>Dynamic Wealth:</h2>
            <p>Working at the Aresty Research Center alongside Dr. Sopher, we were concerned with developing a way of
                determining optimal portfolio ceilings in order to maximize wealth generation in a dynamic process.
                Utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, we were able to quickly run thousands of runs on several different
                parameterizations. I then used what we learned to create a survey to test people's ability to accurately
                place these ceilings themselves and compare them to the optimized values we arrived at through our Monte
                Carlo simulations.</p>

            <h2>AudioMac:</h2>
            <p>Trading interviews are <i>HARD</i>. On top of all the advanced
            mathematics there is to nail, there is often a mental math portion that
            forces candidates to think quickly and accuratey, simulating life on the trading 
            floor! AudioMac is derived from the drilling tool Zetamac, but with a fun twist-questions are
            asked verbally via a device's speakers and the user is able to respond back verbally,
            better simulating an interview experience! Free to use, and customizable, AudioMac
            is a perfect drilling tool for anyone preparing for interviews or wanting to keep a 
            sharp mind!

            <h2>The Prosperity Index:</h2>
            <p> I was lucky enough to be invited to J.P. Morgan Chase's
                2023 Data for Good event! It was a fantastic experience leveraging my
                technical skills for the common good. My team and I were tasked with ingesting
                over 240,000 individual pieces of health, education, crime and economic data for states across the
                U.S. to identify 3 target cities that the non profit organization we were partnered with could expand to.
                We utilized a k means clustering algorithm and were able to determine 3 perfect locations! The judges were impressed
                with our work and we were able to take home 3rd place!
